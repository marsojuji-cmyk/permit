"""
Permit: the authorization layer. Decides what an agent is ALLOWED to spend.

Authority check (Grok review fix — cumulative reservation):
    amount(a) <= remaining(P)
    AND merchant(a) IN allowlist(P)
    AND now < expiry(P)
    AND NOT revoked(P)

    remaining(P) = cap(P) − reserved(P) − captured(P)

An authorization hold RESERVES cap; capture moves reserved→captured;
void releases the reservation. Parallel attempts serialize on the permit
(per-permit lock), so concurrent attempts cannot exceed the cap (test C1).

A failed check writes a BLOCKED receipt and never reaches PayPal.
This module MUST NOT import any PayPal client (enforced by import test).

E-stop: revoke() flips the permit to revoked and returns the in-flight
authorization ids the settlement layer must void. The e-stop is itself
a receipted event.

Expiry semantics (authority definition — binding on all workstreams):
    Expiry is evaluated at BOTH boundaries, never just one:
    1. Check time — check()/eligible() block any attempt on an expired
       (or missing, or revoked) permit.
    2. Release/capture-admission time — the settlement layer MUST re-admit
       the permit via permits.get() immediately before capture and refuse
       when the permit is missing, revoked, or expired at that moment.
    Release after expiry therefore fails closed: an escrow authorized
    against a then-valid permit cannot capture once the permit has
    expired or been revoked. This module defines the rule; the settlement
    workstream enforces the admission check at capture time.

Amount discipline (P1-3 witness fix): amounts are positive integers.
_validate_amount() guards the authority boundary (check() and grant());
an invalid amount never reserves, never raises through check() — it is
recorded as a BLOCKED receipt with reason "invalid_amount".

Tighten-only min-gate (v4): a live permit can be NARROWED after issuance
via tighten() — lower cap, fewer merchants, sooner expiry — but never
widened. A tighten cascades to every descendant: each child keeps the
narrower of its own authority and the parent's new bound, so the whole
subtree obeys the tightened mandate with no ancestor walk at check time.
Every tighten writes a TIGHTEN receipt with old→new per narrowed clause;
cascaded applications carry cascade_from. A tighten that would widen or
leave authority unchanged is rejected.
